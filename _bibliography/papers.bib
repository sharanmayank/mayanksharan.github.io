  abstract={Deep probabilistic forecasting is gaining attention in numerous applications ranging from weather prognosis, through electricity consumption estimation, to autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction. However, existing approaches focus on improvements on the most common scenarios without addressing the performance on rare and difficult cases. In this work, we identify a long tail behavior in the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning methods on probabilistic forecasting. We present two moment-based tailedness measurement concepts to improve performance on the difficult tail examples: Pareto Loss and Kurtosis Loss. Kurtosis loss is a symmetric measurement as the fourth moment about the mean of the loss distribution. Pareto loss is asymmetric measuring right tailedness, modeling the loss using a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). We demonstrate the performance of our approach on several real-world datasets including time series and spatiotemporal trajectories, achieving significant improvements on the tail examples.}

  year={2020},
  abstract={Smoking addiction is a growing social epidemic affecting about 1 in 5 adults in the world directly and many more in the form of passive smoking. Diagnostic tools to determine the nicotine addiction are either unreliable or restrictive in their use. This makes identification and assessment less accessible for those who need it. We attempted to evaluate eye tracking paired with machine learning as an alternative to existing diagnostic tools for assessing nicotine dependence.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
