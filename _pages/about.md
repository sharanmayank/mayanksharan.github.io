I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Bidgely](https://www.bidgely.com/). My primary interests are Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Recommender Systems. At Bidgely, I work mainly with energy data and associated information designing and developing industry leading AI solutions.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) with a specialisation in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. I worked with [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) on [Indian Legal Dataset Analysis](https://sharanmayank.github.io/files/BTP_Report.pdf) and worked with [Prof. Rahul](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~rahulgarg/) on [Detecting Severity of Nicotine Addiction via Eye Tracking](https://engrxiv.org/b3vqk/).
