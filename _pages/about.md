I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science and Engineering at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). My advisor is [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/). 

**Research**: I have broad interests in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Currently, my work focuses on natural language processing, spatiotemporal machine learning, and reinforcement learning. In the past, I have worked with recommender systems, causal inference, and computer vision.

**Previously**: I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [Bidgely](https://www.bidgely.com/). I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, from [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) where I worked with [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) and [Rahul Garg](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rahulgarg/).
